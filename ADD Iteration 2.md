Step 1: Reviewing Inputs
Before starting Iteration 2, we reviewed the architectural drivers and system inputs defined in iteration 1 to ensure that their priorities were still accurate and aligned with the current system needs.
Since Iteration 2 more focuses on the primary workflow of the platform, the drivers influencing this iteration still are:

UC-1: Student Sign-in
UC-2: System Maintainer Monitors Performance
UC-3: Managing Users

Quality Attributes
QA-1 Security & Traceability
QA-2 Availability
QA-3 Usability
QA-4 Maintainability
QA-6 Performance Efficiency

Constraints
CON-1: Multi-device and multi-OS support
CON-2: High concurrency across user sessions
CON-3: Accessibility and inclusive UI requirements
CON-4: Data protection through encryption and audit logging

Step 2: Establish Iteration Goal
The goal of this iteration is to identify and define sructures that directly support the primary use cases, and these include:
UC-1
CRN-1
CON-1
CON-3

Step 3: Choose Elements of the System to Refine

STEP 5:

2: Create a dedicated autentication and role-management module
Supports SSO, traceability and role based UI. 
(UC-1, UC-3, QA-1)

3: Create a operational monitoring module
Supports a dashboard populated with metrics and the status of the various parts of the application.
(UC-2)

4: Create a personalization module
Stores user preferences regarding language, conversation style, UI mode and notification settings
(UC-4, QA-5)
