Iteration 1:

Step 1: Confirm Inputs
The design purpose is to create an efficient architecture for the deployment of our AIDAP. 
AIDAP is a greenfield system, meaning the first iteration goal is to establish an overall system structure (addressing CRN-1)

Step 2: Establish Iteration Goal by Selecting Drivers
Since the AIDAP is a greenfield system, its important to establish structure as soon as possible.

We will focus on drivers related to structure:

UC-1
CRN-1
CON-1
CON-3

These five drivers outline a basic structure and starting point for our design.

Step 3: Choose Elements of the System to Refine

We are going to focus on refiing the basic structure we need to create from scratch.

Step 4:
