Business Case

In today's world, modern digital learning environments rely on several independent systems for academic and administrative operations. Schedules, announcements, grades, and communications are usually handled by their own individual systems such as the Learning Management System (LMS), registration systems, etc. The issue here is that finding information quickly, maintaining awareness of deadlines, and managing courses efficiently become difficult for users, resulting in students, admins, and lecturers having to navigate between different workflows and interfaces which wastes time and energy. Ideally situation each stakeholder should be able to have access information, keep track of updates and maintain consistent data across platorms without wasting time and fragmented communication.

Our main concern here is efficiency and accessibility. Students need a unified way to recieve notifications, have access to course materials, and contact lecturers academic questions or inquiries, Lecturers should be able to post announcements, monitor engagement/class analytics without repeating steps across seperate systems. 

To address these concerns, an AI-Powered Digital Assistant Platform (AIDAP) is being developed to unify all of these systems under one intelligent interface. This platform applies natural language processing to interpret user queries and deliver useful and cohesive responses. It is capable of integrating securely with already existing systems using standardized APIs, ensuring interoperability and data consistency while maintaining privacy and security. This platform will integrate academic and administrative tools, streamline the flow of information and improve the coordination between users.
