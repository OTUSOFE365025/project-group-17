Business Case

Modern digital learning environments rely on several independent systems for academic and administrative operations. Schedules, announcements, grades, and communications are usually handled by their own individual systems such as the Learning Management System (LMS), registration systems, etc. The issue here is that accessing information quickly, maintaining awareness of deadlines, and managing courses efficiently become difficult for users, resulting in them having to navigate between different workflows and interfaces which wastes time and energy. Ideally situation each stakeholder should be able to have access information, keep track of updates and maintain consistent data across platorms without wasting time and fragmented communication.

Our main concern here is efficiency and accessibility. Students need a unified way to recieve notifications, have access to course materials, and contact lecturers academic questions or inquiries, Lecturers should be able to post announcements, monitor engagement/class analytics without repeating steps across seperate systems. Administrators and system maintainers require consistent visibility into performance, latency, and system health to ensure continuous service with minimal downtime. Current systems do not provide this level of integration, traceability, or adaptability to user needs.

To address these concerns, an AI-Powered Digital Assistant Platform (AIDAP) is being developed to unify all of these systems under one intelligent interface. This system applies natural language processing to interpret user queries and deliver useful and cohesive responses. It is capable of integrating securely with already existing systems using standardized APIs, ensuring interoperability and data consistency while maintaining privacy and security.

AIDAP will be designed in such a way that it will meet performance and availability targets, including 99.5% uptime, response times within seconds, and support for up to 5000 concurrent users and 50 administrative sessions. This system incorporates single sign-on for secure authentication, accessibility features such as screen readers and text-to-speech, and adaptive personalization that adjusts to user preferences across devices. It will also be compatible with a wide variety of devices and operating systems. Once this is deployed, it will drastically improve efficiency, reduce redundancy, and streamline the flow of information across different operations and improve the coordination between users. AIDAP will a foundation for smarter, faster and more accessible digital interation by consolidating essential services into one reliable and scalable solution.
