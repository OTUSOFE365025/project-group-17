CRN-1 

Properly designing a reactive UI for user interaction across devices and
operating systems while remaining accessible to those with disabilities can
prove a difficult task. Proper sizing and compatibility issues will need to 
be addressed.

CRN-2 

Proper estimation of load during peak times to ensure no slowdowns or
crashes will be difficult. Reviewing previous user data of existing systems and
public surveys will need to be conducted to ensure the application is scaled
properly. Also knowing in advance when major events like exams, midterms
and orientation day is happening will be important to prepare with temporary
infrastructure.

CRN-3

Creating a modular system that satisfies the needs of an entire university 
ecosystem is a daunting task. Updates and maintainance to one department may
impact another. Proper version control, QA testing and decoupled programming
will all be required throughout the development lifecycle and beyond.

CRN-4

System crashes could lead to data loss to large amounts of people. Regular 
back-ups and testing of said back-ups will be imperative to minimize losses
accross the campus, and speed up recovery times in the event of downtime.
