<h2>Step 2: Establish Iteration Goals by Selecting Drivers</h2>
For this iteration, we would like to focus on QA-2, availability:
The system should remain operational and accessible 99.5% of the time or higher. Scheduled maintenance should cause minimal disruption, and automatic failover mechanisms should recover from crashes or downtime instantly to maintain continuous service availability.



<h2>Step 5: </h2>
1: Introduce caching and load balancing.

Keeping frequently asked questions as well as relevant information to the conversation
in the cache will reduce response times greatly by reducing database queries.
Load balancing will reduce the chances of a single server being overloaded during
peak times such as students requesting their exam schedules around exam season.
It will also increase throughput by having multiple servers to connect to and respond through.
