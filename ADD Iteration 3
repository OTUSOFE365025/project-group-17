Include in this file the 7 steps for Iteration 3

4: Introduce caching and load balancing.

Keeping frequently asked questions as well as relevant information to the conversation
in the cache will reduce response times greatly by reducing database queries.
Load balancing will reduce the chances of a single serve being overloaded during
peak times such as students requesting their exam schedules around exam season.
It will also increase throughput by having multiple servers to connect to and respond through.
