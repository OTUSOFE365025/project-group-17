Quality Attributes

1. Security and Traceability

    Associated with UC1, UC2, & UC3

    User actions should be tied to the account used to sign into the system, as well as the IP of the device used to sign in. This allows IT to view who does what, retrace and recreate errors as they are reported and take action against malicious users

2. Availability

    Associated with UC2, UC4, & UC6

    The system should remain operational and accessible 99.5% of the time or higher. Scheduled maintenance should cause minimal disruption, and automatic failover mechanisms should recover from crashes or downtime instantly to maintain continuous service availability.

4. Usability

    Associated with UC1, UC4, & UC5

    Menus, notifications, and responses should be visually clear and logically structured so users can navigate the system without confusion. Conversational commands should use simple, natural language that students and staff can easily understand.

6. Maintainability

    Associated with UC3, UC2, & UC6

    System updates, permission changes, and configuration adjustments should be deployable without interrupting user sessions. Logs and modular architecture should allow developers and administrators to quickly isolate, fix, or upgrade specific components without affecting the rest of the platform.

7. Adaptability/Personalization

    Associated with UC1, UC4, & UC5

    The assistant should automatically adjust to each userâ€™s preference (i.e. language, notification style, interface layout, etc.) after sign-in. It should learn from prior interactions to refine recommendations and responses, creating a personalized and consistent experience across devices and sessions.

9. Performance Efficiency

    Associated with UC4 & UC5

    Queries and notifications should be processed and displayed within seconds, even under high system load. The system should optimize network and server performance to maintain quick response times, ensuring uninterrupted interaction for all users.
